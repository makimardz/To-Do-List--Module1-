# Simple To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, delete tasks, view the total number of tasks, clear all tasks, and sort tasks alphabetically. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of native Array ES6 functions, recursion, and integration with a third-party JavaScript library.

## Features

- Add tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
- Delete tasks: Click the delete button (X) next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Display total task count: The application displays the total number of tasks currently in the list.
- Clear all tasks: Click the "Clear All Tasks" button to remove all tasks from the list.
- Sort tasks alphabetically: Click the "Sort Tasks Alphabetically" button to rearrange tasks in alphabetical order.
- Recursively add tasks: The application includes a feature to add tasks recursively until a specified count.
